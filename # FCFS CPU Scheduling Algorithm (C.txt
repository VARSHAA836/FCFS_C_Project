# FCFS CPU Scheduling Algorithm (C Program)

Description
This project implements the **First Come, First Served (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm using the C programming language.

FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue (FIFO – First In, First Out).

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used
**First Come, First Served (FCFS)**

- The first process to arrive gets executed first.
- Once a process starts executing, it runs till completion.
- No priority or time slicing is involved.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Burst Time (BT)
- Waiting Time (WT)
- Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Average Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround Time

## 📝 Formulae Used
- **Waiting Time (WT)**  
  WT₀ = 0  
  WTᵢ = BT₀ + BT₁ + ... + BTᵢ₋₁  

- **Turnaround Time (TAT)**  
  TAT = WT + BT  

## 💻 Program Features
- Accepts number of processes
- Takes burst time for each process
- Calculates:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
- Displays results in tabular format

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

### Compile
```bash
gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs
